-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Target:
Make the model lighter, by adding GAP and removing last big kernal.

Results:
Parameters: 4.9K
Best Train Accuracy: 99.02
Best Test Accuracy: 99.02
Analysis: Model accuracies have decreased due to reduction in model size/capacity.

Target:
Increase model performance by increasing model size. i.e by adding extra layers at the end.

Results:
Parameters: 7.2K
Best Train Accuracy: 99.47
Best Test Accuracy: 99.23
Analysis: Model accuracies have increased with increase in model size/capacity. The model is also performing consistently.
